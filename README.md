The R script called run_analysis.R does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. Print this independent tidy data to a text file in your working directory.

Please note:  The comments within the R script should help understand which areas are being accomplished at each stage.
